          <h3>Coding BootCamp Student</h3>
          <p>
            During my coding bootcamp, I engaged in a comprehensive curriculum that covered 
            a spectrum of services essential in modern software development. I honed my skills 
            in full-stack web development, creating dynamic and responsive websites using HTML,
             CSS, and JavaScript, and implementing server-side logic with technologies like 
             Node.js.The bootcamp fostered a collaborative environment where I worked on group projects, implementing version 
             control with Git and applying agile methodologies for efficient project management. 
             I also gained proficiency in database management and API integration. Throughout the program, I tackled algorithmic 
             challenges, enhancing my problem-solving abilities. The bootcamp not only equipped me with
              a diverse technical skill set but also emphasized the importance of soft skills and effective
               communication in a team-oriented development environment.</p>
