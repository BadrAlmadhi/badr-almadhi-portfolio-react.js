        <h3>Coding BootCamp Graduate</h3>
        <p>
          My journey into coding began at the University of Utah while pursuing
          my Bachelor's degree in Architecture/Urban Planning. In my studies, I
          came across technologies like Geographic Information System (GIS) and
          AutoCAD, where coding proved essential for enhancing their functions.
          Intrigued, I spent a year teaching myself coding to see if I wanted to
          make it my career. The more I learned, the more I fell in love with
          it. Despite the challenges, I kept going. Eventually, I decided to
          attend a coding bootcamp with Georgia Tech University, where I gained
          skills in both front-end and back-end development, graduating
          successfully. Now, I'm excited to apply my knowledge and looking for
          opportunities to kickstart my journey in tech development.
